This project is still in progress.

noise.cpp is my attempt at some simple terrian generation without perlin noise.
main_sfml.cpp is a old attempt at simulating a population.
I hope to one day combine the 2 into 1 project.

Terrian is currently generated using the sum of 2d sinusoidal functions that are rotated.
Rivers are being generated using A* with heuristics for height change, distance travelled and distance to the end.
