This project is still in progress.

noise.cpp is my attempt at some simple terrian generation without perlin noise.
main_sfml.cpp is a old attempt at simulating a population.
I hope to one day simulate a population on generated terrain.

Terrian is currently generated using the sum of 2d sinusoidal functions that are rotated.
Rivers are being generated using A* with heuristics for height change, distance travelled and distance to the end. (A lot of constants need adjustment before it looks good)
The time complexity is pretty bad right now, so it takes a while to load.

This requires SFML library to work.
