Todo:
Stop leaking memeory :)
Make all classes secure (Don't make variables public).
Add ability to alter the constants temporarly for debugging.
Rework box to use sf::Vector2f() instead of x, y and sf::Rectangle() instead of x2, y2 and color.
Add more comments.
Properly set up SFML and remove the whole library.
Update README.md.
Make text not overflow boxes using sf::Text::getGlobalBounds to check if it's within the box, otherwise shrinking the font and checking again.
Use .hpp files, and include them instead of the .cpp files.
Use OOP structure.
